 After finishing my high school days back in 2018, usually, we will have a holiday break 

before getting our SPM result. During this time, we can see many people around my age starting 

 to find a job as a way to gain experience or most importantly money to survive the holiday.

 It applies to me as well. I started to look for a job close to my house with my friend. But, later

she had gone back to her "mother" house at Negeri Sembilan. I kind of give up but then one of my 

 friend, Azlin, invite me to work with her at the new 7E store outlet at Penang Sentral as they are  

 looking for new staff. It is because the place is strategic where people come and go either for bus, train or ferry.

 Lucky me, I get the job. Starting then, I will work in morning shift or evening shift. 

 The good news is this 7E does not open 24/7. So, we don't need to work the night shift. It was stressful

 sometimes because of the lack of staff but we managed it. Then, I offered my other friend, Ain, to try apply

 for a job here since she has also been looking for one. And lucky her too, she got it. Now, there is three of 

 us working together because we get the same shift and it is stressful since there are a lot of customers

but look how happy we are.

 Sometimes we ride a motorcycle to work as I'm also in the middle of my getting my driving license (I got an L license).

If I work the evening shift with my friends, we would get off at 11 p.m. and we would stop by at any restaurant that open until

late night. This is when I and Azlin just got my first salary. We decided to eat western food that night as a celebration

for our hard work in one month. There is a night when we stop by the RnR Bagan by the sea just to enjoy the night breeze. There

are a lot of people there so it is not that quiet. Lively even. Also, special moment when I help a tourist and need to speak

English. I tried my best and there is one tourist who appreciate my help by giving me RM1 and I still keep it as a memory.

Usually, they would ask for help in assisting their internet data. In the end, it all went well. The tourist was happy

with our services and help even though they just asking for direction. So, this is my experience of working part-time at 

7E Penang Sentral. It gives me a good and slightly bad memory but still, I can gain an experience of working.
